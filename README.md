# Item Catalog Application
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop an application that provides a list
of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration
and authentication system.  Registered users will have the ability to post,
edit, and delete their own items.  I had to combine my knowledge of building
dynamic website with persistent data storage to create a web application that
provides a compelling service to my users.
